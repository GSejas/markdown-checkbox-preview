# Tree Navigation Test

## Implementation Summary

Successfully added **clickable header navigation** to the tree view with minimal changes:

### Changes Made:

1. **Modified `CheckboxTreeItem` constructor**:
   - Detects headers vs checkboxes by level (headers: level < 6, checkboxes: level >= 6)
   - Headers get file icon and "Go to Header" command
   - Checkboxes keep existing toggle behavior

2. **Added `navigateToHeader()` method** to `CheckboxTreeDataProvider`:
   - Positions cursor at header line
   - Centers the view on target line
   - Focuses the editor

3. **Registered new command** `checkboxTree.navigateToHeader`:
   - Added command registration in extension.ts
   - Added to context subscriptions

### How It Works:

In the **Explorer sidebar "Markdown Checkboxes" tree**:
- **Headers** (H1-H6) now have file icons and show "H1", "H2", etc. as description
- **Checkboxes** keep the existing ✓/○ icons and toggle behavior
- **Clicking a header** jumps to that section in the source file
- **Clicking a checkbox** still toggles its state

This provides the minimal "clickable tree navigation" you requested!
